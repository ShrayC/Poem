The meaty smell was overwhelming.
I eagerly lifted some
into my mouth.
It’s crispy taste
on my tongue
was wonderful.

All it’s little bumps,
and imperfections
forming my own
miniature, delicious mountain range.

Years later,
I looked back on that moment.
Remembered how I had savored
the taste.
I don’t have bacon much any more,
but I will always remember
that first taste.
